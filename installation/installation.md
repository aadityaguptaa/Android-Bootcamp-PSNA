<h1>2. Initial Setup</h1>

After installing Android studio on your device, you need to create your first Android Project. Don't worry, you don't need to write even a single line of code, Android Studio does everything for you.

Step 1. Launch Android Studio

Step 2. Click on Start a new Android Studio Project

Android Studio provides a lot of templates to give you a headstart in your project.
Since we are noobs, we'll start with empty Activity.
Step 3. Select Empty Activity and click Next.

Step 4. On the project details page, leave everything at their default value and click Finish. We'll cover all of them in the workshop. 
Wait for a few minutes for the Android Studio setup to finish.
